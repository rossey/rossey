Hi, I'm Alex and I work at <a href="https://wearebase.com">Base</a> near the beach in Bournemouth, UK.
I'm a founding member of the <a href="http://www.phpdorset.co.uk">PHP Dorset User Group</a> and an
organiser of the <a href="http://phpsouthcoast.co.uk">PHP South Coast Conference</a>. In my spare time
I teach the saxophone and play the baritone saxophone with <a href="https://www.inthepinkbigband.co.uk">In the Pink Big Band</a>.
I also enjoy live sound engineering and recording.


I specialise in working with open source technologies and I'm an advocate for clean code.
My skill set includes PHP &amp; the Symfony Stack, MySQL, MongoDB, Jenkins, Ansible, Linux &amp; Security.
